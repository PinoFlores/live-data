/**
 * ### LiveData
 *
 * ```js
 * abstract class LiveData<T>
 * ```
 * This is an observable data structure, that was designed
 * to wrap any other data structure and make it observable.
 * So because of that, when its state change, that new change
 * will be notified to all subscrited observers.
 *
 * Note that this clase expose not mutator functionality, and also
 * is a not instanciable class (because is abstract). The main idea
 * is that this class will be used to provide a type that will be
 * used in two cases:
 * 1. Extentions: You want to create your own impls, like pre-built `MutableLiveData`.
 * 2. Expose immutable data: You want to expose your state/subject as immutable, and provide
 * a common interface to mutate that data.
 *
 * In the example below, we can see `MutableLiveData<Credentials>` which can be mutated, but
 * note that the `public getMutableLiveData(): LiveData<Credentials>` method exposes that `state`
 * as immutable, an this is a very important concept because of two important thing: 1. prevent
 * inconsitent state, and 2. ensure reactivity.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * class LoginViewModel {
 *  private data: MutableLiveData<Credentials>;
 *  public getMutableLiveData(): LiveData<Credentials> {
 *   return this.data;
 *  }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This is possible by using an extention or base principle of
 * the [@joseaburt/event-bus](https://github.com/PinoFlores/event-bus)
 * that is not more than the `Observer Pattern` adaptation in combination
 * with a bus.
 *
 * The idea was for decoupling logic from the any framework or
 * UI library, in this case from `React.js` library.
 *
 * This idea was also inspired from `Android Ecosystem Architecture & Design`.
